### Flood Events Database

**Comprehensive Global Flood Data at Your Fingertips**

Growing up fascinated by the power and unpredictability of water, I became a dedicated hydroinformatics enthusiast, delving deeply into the study of flood events and their impacts. With years of experience under my belt, I recognized a significant gap: there was no comprehensive, publicly accessible global resource for flood data. This lack of information affected not only the general public but also engineers, scientists, researchers, and decision-makers who needed reliable data to make informed choices.

Determined to bridge this gap, I embarked on a mission to create a solution. Thus, the Flood Events Database was bornâ€”a free, open-source web application designed to provide users with real-time, detailed information on flood events from around the world. With this tool, we can better understand flood patterns, prepare for future events, and ultimately save lives.
