Welcome to my projects page! Here you'll find some of the projects I've built. They blend my passion for water, coding, and open-source development.

## HydroHamed

**A Hub for Hydroinformatics Enthusiasts**

I've always felt the need for a comprehensive portal for hydroinformatics. Combining this with my desire for a personal website that serves as a portfolio, blog, and digital garden, I created HydroHamed. This online space is dedicated to sharing knowledge about hydroinformatics. It's designed for engineers, scientists, researchers, and anyone interested in this field. Best of all, it's open-source! You can find all the source code for the website on GitHub and suggest improvements for articles and the overall website.

## Flood Events Database

**A Citizen Science Project for Gathering Flood Events Data**

My interest in citizen science led me to notice a gap in accessible flood information, both for the public and specialists. To address this, I created the Flood Events Database. It's an open-source web application where anyone can find and share information about flood events worldwide.

## Libredraft

**Free, Open-Source, and Lightweight 2D CAD Design**

Libredraft is a free, open-source, and lightweight tool for designing 2D CAD projects directly in your browser. It eliminates the need for bulky software installations or expensive licenses. Libredraft offers a simple, user-friendly interface to create 2D drawings, making CAD design more accessible to everyone.

## Hiro

**Download Manager and Accelerator**

While this project isn't related to water or engineering, I developed it to learn the Go programming language. Meet Hiro, a fast, lightweight download manager and accelerator that enhances your downloading experience.
