Welcome to my projects page! Here you'll find different projects I've worked on. They mix my love for water science, computer programming, and free software.

## Flood Events Database

**A Citizen Science Project for Gathering Flood Events Data**

I've always been interested in studying floods and how they affect people. I noticed there wasn't a good place to find flood information from around the world. So, I created the Flood Events Database. It's a free website where anyone can find and share information about floods. This helps people understand floods better and be more prepared.
