      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Hamed Samsami, a Hydroinformatics Engineer based in the beautiful landscapes of Norway. With over 15 years of experience as a civil engineer, my journey has been deeply rooted in the design and construction of water infrastructure. But my story isn&amp;rsquo;t just about concrete and pipesâ€”it&amp;rsquo;s also about code, algorithms, and the magic that happens when technology meets water.
The Early Days Ever since I was a teenager, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by programming.</description>
