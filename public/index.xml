      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Hamed Samsami, a Hydroinformatics Engineer from Iran, now living in beautiful Norway. My story is about merging two passions: water and technology.
Teenage Coder: The Early Days As a teenager, I spent countless late nights at my computer. While my friends were playing video games and chatting on Yahoo, I was learning to write code and participating in programming competitions.
My interest in computer science never waned. Even while studying civil engineering, I used my free time to build websites for friends, local schools, and various small projects.</description>
