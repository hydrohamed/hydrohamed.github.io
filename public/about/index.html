  "articleBody": "Hi there! I’m Hamed Samsami, a Hydroinformatics Engineer based in the beautiful landscapes of Norway. With over 15 years of experience as a civil engineer, my journey has been deeply rooted in the design and construction of water infrastructure. But my story isn’t just about concrete and pipes—it’s also about code, algorithms, and the magic that happens when technology meets water.\nThe Early Days Ever since I was a teenager, I’ve been fascinated by programming. Back then, I would spend hours tinkering with code, exploring how a few lines could create something functional and, sometimes, even beautiful. As I grew older, my love for water systems and structures led me to pursue a master’s degree in hydraulic structures engineering. Combining these two passions seemed like a natural path, and that’s how I found myself at the intersection of hydraulics and informatics.\nWhat is Hydroinformatics? Hydroinformatics is a specialized field that merges hydrology, hydraulics, and computer science. It’s all about using advanced computational tools and data analysis to solve complex water-related problems. Imagine being able to predict floods, optimize water distribution, or simulate river flows—all through the power of numerical models and algorithms. This field not only enhances our understanding of water systems but also drives innovative solutions for sustainable water management.\nIn my work, I utilize a range of tools and software like R, Python, HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, and SWMM. Each project is a new challenge, a new puzzle to solve, and I love every moment of it.\nThe Digital Garden Now, you might be wondering, what is a Digital Garden? Well, it’s a concept that beautifully aligns with my journey. A digital garden is a space on the internet where ideas, projects, and knowledge grow organically over time. Unlike a traditional blog, which is linear and chronological, a digital garden is more like a collection of interconnected notes and resources. It’s a place where I can share my insights, experiments, and learnings in a way that’s accessible and ever-evolving.\nIn my digital garden, you’ll find a variety of topics ranging from hydroinformatics and AI applications in water management to personal projects and coding tips. It’s a reflection of my continuous learning process and my desire to contribute to the community.\nAt the end Thank you for stopping by my corner of the internet. Feel free to explore, connect, and grow with me. If you share my passion for water, technology, or just love a good engineering challenge, let’s connect and collaborate!\n",
